I will be honest I don't think it works nor it's great but at leas I understand the code
I am hoping for some feedback to work on it and make it work as it is supposed to.

Thank you in advance.

I am unable to connect to the file manager (I did manage earlier today but I had to sort out some connection and files).
I even deleted the whole website and made a new one but still cannot connect. 

There is a screenshot proof in the main folder
